# HNNVAT
Adversarial dense graph convolutional networks for single-cell classification(HNNVAT)
 we innovatively applied a hybrid neural network based on virtual adversarial training to identify cell types. 
 The model uses a convolutional neural network with the dense connectivity mechanism and uses the attention mechanism to aggregate, and improves the generalization performance of the model through virtual adversarial training.
 High prediction performance and case studies for single cells demonstrate the feasibility of our method. We believe this article is valuable for all researchers who are interested in single-cell classification.
# Train the model
  1. Please download the single cell data from the dataset website and update the local dataset path in the HNNVAT      file(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3357167)
  2. The model is trained by running HNNVAT files
